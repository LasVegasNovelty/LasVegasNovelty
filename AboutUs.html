        A journey through the history of Las Vegas is what prompted this 
        Website.
        Teri Klover was part of a Family Band of six siblings 
        known as the “Sandovals”.  They performed their musical show 
        At the Fremont Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1955.  At that time, 
        They were booked on stage, alternating with Wayne Newton and his 
        Brother.
        As the Sandoval children grew and developed their own families, 
        Teri continued working with different bands, singing and playing 
        Lead guitar
        mostly in the Las Vegas, Reno 
        and Lake Tahoe areas.  She worked with Lounge bands and 
        Show Bands in nearly every Hotel downtown and on the Las Vegas Strip.  

        Over the years, Teri, now 82 years old,  had compiled 
        A collection of Souvenirs and Memorabilia from the Las Vegas area.  
        These are the bases of items that are offered in this Website along with some Specialty items.
        Teri Kover-Wamsley is also the artist of the paintings in our “Art Gallery”.
        Now, Teri is the assistant to her Grandson, Nicky Klover, who at 
        The ripe old age of 12, is the builder and designer of this Website.
        Stay tuned for further developments!
