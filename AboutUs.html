        A journey through the history of Las Vegas is what prompted this 
        Website.
        Teri Klover was part of a Family Band of six siblings 
        known as the “Sandovals”.  They  began performing  their musical show in Las Vegas in 1957.  They were booked 
        at the Fremont Hotel where they alternated shows  with Wayne Newton and his 
        Brother.
        As the Sandoval children grew and developed their own families, 
        Teri continued working with different bands, singing and playing 
        Lead guitar
         mostly in the Las Vegas, Reno 
        and Lake Tahoe areas.  She worked with Lounge bands and 
        Show Bands in nearly every Hotel downtown and on the Las Vegas Strip.  She eventually was part of a trio called “Wildflower”.  They were featured at the Westward Ho (across from the Riviera Hotel) for
        more than 10 years.

        Over the years, Teri, now 82 years old,  had compiled 
        A collection of Souvenirs and Memorabilia from the Las Vegas area.  
        These are the basis of items that are offered in this Website along with some Specialty items.
        She was known as Teri Kover on stage, then later became Teri Wamsley.  She then ventured out and painted murals for 20 years all over town.  The 
        “Art Gallery” included in this site, features her artwork mostly on canvas, 
        painted with love and acrylics. 
        Now, Teri is the assistant to her Grandson, Nicky Klover, who at 
        The ripe old age of 12, is the builder and designer of this Website and he keeps “Nana” on her toes!
        Stay tuned for further developments!
